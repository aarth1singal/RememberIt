## Project Overview

**Remember It** is a robotic assistant designed to help patients adhere to their medication schedules, ensuring they take the correct dose at the right time. Our bot holds a plate with the prescribed medication and provides water, making it easier and more accessible for patients to follow their prescribed treatment plans. The primary goal of **Remember It** is to prioritize patient safety and promote better health outcomes.

## The Problem

Medication non-adherence is a major issue, especially for patients with chronic diseases. Over half of the medications prescribed are not taken as directed, which leads to serious health risks and contributes to 125,000 preventable deaths in the U.S. annually. Additionally, this issue results in significant economic costs, with over $300 billion in expenses attributed to poor medication adherence each year.

Contributing factors include:
- **Financial Costs**: High costs of medication lead to non-adherence.
- **Accessibility**: Difficulty in managing multiple prescriptions.
- **Loneliness & Social Isolation**: A lack of social support worsens medical outcomes.
- **Patient Vulnerability**: Older adults and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected.

## The Solution

**Remember It** addresses these issues through a multifunctional robot assistant that:
- Provides medication reminders at scheduled times.
- Dispenses water to assist with swallowing pills.
- Uses voice interaction to remind patients and offer a sense of companionship.
- Tracks patient adherence and alerts caregivers if doses are missed.

## Key Features
- **Water Dispensing Tool**: Provides water alongside medication to assist patients.
- **Voice Chatbot**: Reminds patients to take their medication and offers friendly interaction.
- **Medication Reminder**: Ensures timely intake of medicine with voice and visual cues.

## Future Improvements

We aim to enhance **Remember It** with several advanced features:
- **Motion Tracking**: Detects patient movements and adapts accordingly for better responsiveness.
- **Improved Medicine Dispenser**: Tracks medicine supplies and automatically orders refills when needed.
- **SOS System**: Alerts caregivers or medical professionals in case of emergencies, ensuring an added layer of safety for patients.

## Impact

By increasing adherence to prescribed treatments, **Remember It** can reduce the risks of non-adherence-related complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Our solution also addresses social isolation by providing companionship, which is especially critical for elderly and vulnerable patients.
